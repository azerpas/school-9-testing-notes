# TDD
- A technique to make test and production code work together
- Not for every situation

## Rules
- Shall not write production code unless it is to make a failing test pass
- Once all tests pass, you have to stop and consider a refactoring
- Keep your cycles shorts
### Isolation
Each test can be run independently of the others

## Killer features
- Easy to organize pair programming in ping pong mode
- I can stop and restart my work at any time
- Coverage is no more a concern
- Bugs easier to handle
- Bug detected earlier
- Better predictability
- No more debugger to use
- Code API is cleaner
- Fast feedback
- Documentation
- Better confidence in code and tests
